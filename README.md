# Buildo

Buildo is a small collection of generators to jump-start building a rails application.

Buildo sets up Oath and Oath Lockdown for authentication, and installs some scaffolding. 

Suggested: create your Rails app first with Thoughtbot's [Suspenders](https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders).
